# Welcome to BDD training by Codurance

In this repo, you'll find the base projects for the exercises to be developed during the training

Please fork this repo into your local accounts and share it with your assigned partner(s)

Make sure all team members have write access to this and try not to look ahead at anything


## Projects:

* Java base application with simple JUnit5, AssertJ and Mockito to be used during the first coding exercise
* Java base application with Cucumber, JUnit5 and Mockito integrations ready, to be used during 2nd and 3rd exercise


## Notes
The projects presented are over-simplifications of real case studies. Real production apps will have dozens if not more dependencies lying around
